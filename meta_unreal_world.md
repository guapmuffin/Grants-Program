## Project Description :page_facing_up: 

Crypto games have been a disappointment. They aren't fun & there isn't an easy way to make money from them.

To solve that, we are developing an adventure-filled, enjoyable AAA game where you can earn money while playing and can own in-game assets.

Developed in Unreal Engine 5, Meta Unreal World is a hyper-realistic, medieval MMORPG with a player-driven economy. MUW is the blockchain version of New World, with the added satisfaction and endless possibilities of RuneScape & World of Warcraft.

We are seeking 10 months of financing to complete the first two games of Meta Unreal World: Arena (PvP Battle game), and King of the Table (Turn-Based Trading Card Game, mobile compatible). Both games will be incorporated into the main game, Meta Unreal World: Pioneer Island (MMORPG). 

Once the first two games are complete and we have our MVP, we will seek 48 months of financing to complete the main MMORPG, Meta Unreal World: Pioneer Island
